## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for rainfall prediction. It utilizes time series data and deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nyvwftb5O54ZEJEGCOg590zR4E1Xt9Lf/view?usp=drive_link
- `model/`: Placeholder for saving the trained model.
- `rainfall_prediction.py`: Python script containing the code for data preparation, model creation, training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: 

## Data Preparation
- You need to load your time series data into the appropriate variables (`trainX`, `trainY`, `valX`, `valY`). Ensure that your data is properly preprocessed and split into training and validation sets.

## Model Architecture

## Models

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a straightforward statistical method used for predicting a target variable based on one or more independent variables. In this project, Linear Regression is employed to predict rainfall levels based on various meteorological features and satellite remote sensing data.

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to model sequential data effectively. They are employed here for time series prediction of rainfall, incorporating satellite remote sensing information for improved accuracy.

- The project utilizes LSTM layers to model the temporal patterns in the data.
- Three LSTM layers with dropout are stacked to capture complex dependencies.
- The output layer is a Dense layer.
- The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

## Training and Evaluation
- The model is trained for a maximum of 500 epochs with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Model checkpoints are saved to `best_model.h5` during training.
- Training and validation performance is logged for analysis.

## Model Deployment
- The best-trained model can be deployed for real-world applications.
- Consider using web applications, APIs, or integration into existing systems for deployment.

## Usage
To run the provided code and train your rainfall prediction model:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed by running:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Load your time series data into the script (`trainX`, `trainY`, `valX`, `valY`).

3. Run the `rainfall_prediction.py` script:


4. Monitor the training process and evaluate the model's performance.
